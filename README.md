This is a project for automating browsing testing on the website https://globalnav-pro.hp.com/at/de/globalhf.html . 

It is still in its early stages of development, and I will be updating with xml documents and manifest.json for the program to be executable.

I'm still working on the different dynos needed to automatically connect to saucerlabs and crossbrosertesting.com.
Using the get.environ() method I will try to scale vertically cross browser testing. 

This code has Several Dependencies 
Java 8,
Selenium version 1.8.0,
Selenium Webdriver version 6.9,
Mashape API, and
Maven.
